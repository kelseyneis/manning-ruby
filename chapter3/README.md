## Chapter 3 topics:

- How writing a class and then creating instances of that class allows you to share behaviors among numerous objects.
- How to use setter and getter methods, either written out or automatically created with the attr_* family of methods, to create object attributes, which store an object’s state in instance variables.
- As objects, classes can have methods added to them on a per-object basis—such methods being commonly known as class methods, and providing general utility functionality connected with the class.
- Ruby constants are a special kind of identifier usually residing inside class (or module) definitions.
- Inheritance is a class-to-class relationship between a superclass and one or more subclasses, and all Ruby objects have a common ancestry in the Object and BasicObject classes.
- The superclass/subclass structure can lend itself to modeling entities in a strictly hierarchical, taxonomical way, but the dynamic qualities of Ruby objects (including class objects) can offer less strictly determined ways of thinking about objects and how their behaviors might unfold over the course of their lives.
